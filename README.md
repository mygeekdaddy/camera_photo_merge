# Camera Photo Merge

Revised: 2019-01-02

Pythonista script that prompts you to take two pictures and then automatically merges the two images into a single image and saves it to your camera roll. The script will verify that both images are the same orientation and merge them together with a small border around each image. 

**UPDATE:** Python 3 branch includes code for Pythonista to open Launcher and run crash setting to return back to home screen after completing photo merge.
